| Supervised Machine Learning Iris Species Classification Model    | 2024   | Designed and implemented a supervised machine learning model using the Random Forest algorithm to classify iris species based on sepal and petal dimensions. Leveraged the Iris dataset, splitting it into training and testing sets for model evaluation. Created visualizations to highlight the relationship between flower dimensions and species classification.                          |
| Artificial Intelligence Pacman Ghost Tracking and Inference Program    | 2024   | Implemented AI algorithms using Bayesian Networks for exact and approximate inference to track invisible ghosts in a custom Pacman Ghostbusters game, leveraging Manhattan distance and probabilistic modeling for position estimation.                          |
| Autonomous Tractor     | 2022   | Designed and built an autonomous tractor with integrated sensors for independent navigation and obstacle avoidance. Developed a real-time interactive GUI to enable dynamic control and monitoring of the tractor's operations.                           |
